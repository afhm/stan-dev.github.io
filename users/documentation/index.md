# Language Manual

The Stan modeling language manual contains a guide to programming in Stan
with an extensive collection of modeling techniques and accompanying example
models.  Additionally, the manual serves as reference manual for the language
itself, and a reference guide to the built-in special functions and probability
functions.  Stan's modeling language is portable across all interfaces.

# Wiki Documentation

The Stan Wiki is largely focused on development documentation but it also
includes a few pages with helpful information for users.

# Tutorials

The Stan development team and many users have contributed tutorials aimed at introducing users to various aspects of statistical modeling with Stan, both
in written and visual formats.  These tutorials can be found at

* <p><a href="/users/documentation/tutorials.html">Tutorials</a></p>

# Case Studies and Notebooks

Case studies provide longer, more-detailed discussion of various
applications, models, and methodologies.  Each case study is written
in knitr or Jupyter notebooks so that the discussion is accompanied
with working code.  Case studies written or validated by the Stan
development team can be found at

* <p><a href="/users/documentation/case-studies.html">
  Case Studies</a></p>

The proceedings of each Stan Conference also take the form of
self-contained notebooks.  Contributions for each conference can
be found in their corresponding GibHub repository:

  </p>

# The Stan Forums

The most up to date discussion of modeling techniques and computational
issues if often found in the Stan Forums before it ends up in a case study
or a paper.

* <p><a href="http://discourse.mc-stan.org/">Stan Forums</a>
<span class="note">(Discourse)</span></p>

Discussions prior to June 2017 are achived and public on the now deprecated
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/stan-users">Stan Users Google Group</a>.

# Example Models

The quick start guides for each [interface](/users/interfaces/) contain
example models for demonstrating how to run Stan.

The Stan modeling language manual contains many other model examples to
illustrate various modeling and coding techniques in Stan.

A larger set of example models translating the BUGS examples (Volumes
1 through 3) and the models from several Bayesian textbooks are also
available on GibHub,

# Specialized Field Guides

Tutorials, case studies, software packages, and publications related to
specific fields.

# External References

Finally, there are many works that elaborate on aspects of Stan from
algorithms to applications.  Some of the more relevant references can be
